## Oct 2024 update
I'm on the job market due to a recent furlough. I'm looking for remote senior/staff engineer roles.
I have ~10 years of experience at startups, generally full-stack and flexible to lean either front- or back-end as needed.
Due to the nature of the furlough, I'm open to part-time or contract roles. Feel free to reach out!

## Outside of work
I'm part of the board of [Boston Dodgeball League](https://www.youtube.com/@BostonDodgeballLeague). I'm excited to grow the sport of competitive dodgeball in Boston!
